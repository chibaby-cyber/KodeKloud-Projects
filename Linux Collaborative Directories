The Nautilus team doesn't want its data to be accessed by any of the other groups/teams due to security reasons and want their data to be strictly accessed by the devops group of the team. 
Setup a collaborative directory /devops/data on Nautilus App 3 server in Stratos Datacenter. 
The directory should be group owned by the group devops and the group should own the files inside the directory. The directory should be read/write/execute to the group owners, and others should not have any access.

Steps
ssh banner@172.16.238.12
sudo mkdir -p /devops/data #Create directory
sudo chgrp -R devops /devops/data #change group with access to files and directories
sudo chmod -R 2770 /devops/data #make sure group owns all files in directory
