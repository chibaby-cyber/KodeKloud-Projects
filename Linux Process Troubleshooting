The production support team of xFusionCorp Industries has deployed some of the latest monitoring tools to keep an eye on every service, application, etc. running on the systems. One of the monitoring systems reported about Apache service unavailability on one of the app servers in Stratos DC.



Identify the faulty app host and fix the issue. Make sure Apache service is up and running on all app hosts. They might not hosted any code yet on these servers so you need not to worry about if Apache isn't serving any pages or not, just make sure service is up and running. Also, make sure Apache is running on port 5004 on all app servers.

Solution
Check which app server has issue with apache server and port
telnet stapp01 5004
ssh into app server
sudo systemctl start httpd #failed to start
sudo systemctl status httpd #Got an error (98)Address already in use: AH00072: make_sock: could not bind to address 0.0.0.0:5004

Troubleshooting error
sudo ss -4 -tlnp | grep 5004
kill process using port 
sudo kill pid
sudo systemctl start httpd
sudo systemctl status httpd
