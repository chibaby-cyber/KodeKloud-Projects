The Nautilus production support team and security team had a meeting last month in which they decided to use local yum repositories for maintaing packages needed for their servers. For now they have decided to configure a local yum repo on Nautilus Backup Server. This is one of the pending items from last month, so please configure a local yum repository on Nautilus Backup Server as per details given below.



a. We have some packages already present at location /packages/downloaded_rpms/ on Nautilus Backup Server.

b. Create a yum repo named localyum and make sure to set Repository ID to localyum. Configure it to use package's location /packages/downloaded_rpms/.

c. Install package vim-enhanced from this newly created repo.

Steps
ssh in to server
sudo yum repolist #check if there is any repolist
cd /etc/yum.repos.d/
sudo vi localyum.repo

Insert below in repo file
[localyum]
Name=localyum
baseurl=file:///packages/downloaded_rpms/
enabled=1
gpgcheck=0

sudo yum install vim-enhanced -y
sudo yum list vim-enhanced
