One of the Nautilus developers has copied confidential data on the jump host in Stratos DC. That data must be copied to one of the app servers. 
Because developers do not have access to app servers, they asked the system admins team to accomplish the task for them.



Copy /tmp/nautilus.txt.gpg file from jump server to App Server 1 at location /home/webdata.

Steps
scp /tmp/nautilus.txt.gpg tony@172.16.238.10:/home/webdata
 ssh tony@172.16.238.10
 cd /home/webdata
 
 NOTE
====
IF SCP IS NOT INSTALLING FOLLOW BELOW COMMAND
    1  sudo yum install -y openssh-clients openssh
