#A developer jim has been assigned Nautilus project temporarily as a backup resource. 
#As a temporary resource for this project, we need a temporary user for jim. 
#Itâ€™s a good idea to create a user with a set expiration date so that the user won't be able to access servers beyond that point.

#Therefore, create a user named jim on the App Server 1. Set expiry date to 2021-12-07 in Stratos Datacenter. 
#Make sure the user is created as per standard and is in lowercase.

Steps
ssh into App Server 1
ssh tony@172.16.238.10
sudo useradd -e 2021-12-07 jim
