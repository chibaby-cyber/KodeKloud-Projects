The system admins team of xFusionCorp Industries has set up some scripts on jump host that run on regular intervals and perform operations on all app servers in 
Stratos Datacenter. To make these scripts work properly we need to make sure the thor user on jump host has password-less SSH access to all app 
servers through their respective sudo users (i.e tony for app server 1). Based on the requirements, perform the following:

Set up a password-less authentication from user thor on jump host to all app servers through their respective sudo users.

Steps
ssh-keygen -t rsa
ssh-copy-id tony@172.16.238.10 #for app_server1
ssh-copy-id steve@172.16.238.11 #for app server2
ssh-copy-id banner@172.16.238.12 #for app server3
