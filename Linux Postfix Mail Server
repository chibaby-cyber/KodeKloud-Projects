xFusionCorp Industries has planned to set up a common email server in Stork DC. After several meetings and recommendations they have decided to use postfix as their mail transfer agent and dovecot as an IMAP/POP3 server. We would like you to perform the following steps:



Install and configure postfix on Stork DC mail server.

Create an email account kirsty@stratos.xfusioncorp.com identified by B4zNgHA7Ya.

Set its mail directory to /home/kirsty/Maildir.

Install and configure dovecot on the same server.

Solution
ssh into mail server
sudo yum install postfix -y
sudo systemctl status postfix.service
sudo vi /etc/postfix/main.cf

do the required configuration
sudo systemctl start postfix.service
sudo systemctl status postfix.service
sudo useradd kirsty
sudo passwd kirsty
telnet stmail01 25 #test postfix with telnet
sudo yum install dovecot

sudo vi /etc/dovecot/dovecot.conf
protocols = imap pop3 lmtp
listen = *, :: 

sudo vi /etc/dovecot/conf.d/10-mail.conf
mail_location = maildir:~/Maildir

sudo vi /etc/dovecot/conf.d/10-master.conf
  unix_listener /var/spool/postfix/private/auth {
    mode = 0666
    user = postfix
    group = postfix
  }
  sudo vi /etc/dovecot/conf.d/10-auth.conf
  sudo systemctl enable dovecot
  sudo systemctl start dovecot
  sudo systemctl status dovecot
  telnet stmail01 110
