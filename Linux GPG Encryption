We have confidential data that needs to be transferred to a remote location, so we need to encrypt that data.We also need to decrypt data we received from a remote location in order to understand its content.



On storage server in Stratos Datacenter we have private and public keys stored /home/*_key.asc. Use those keys to perform the following actions.

Encrypt /home/encrypt_me.txt to /home/encrypted_me.asc.

Decrypt /home/decrypt_me.asc to /home/decrypted_me.txt. (Passphrase for decryption and encryption is kodekloud).

Steps
ssh into storage server
run the following commands
cd /home
sudo gpg --import public_key.asc
sudo gpg --import private_key.asc
sudo su
gpg --encrypt -r kodekloud@kodekloud.com --armour < encrypt_me.txt -o encrypted_me.asc
gpg --decrypt decrypt_me.asc > decrypted_me.txt
