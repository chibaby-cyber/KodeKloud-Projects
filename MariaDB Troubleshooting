There is a critical issue going on with the Nautilus application in Stratos DC.
The production support team identified that the application is unable to connect to the database. 
After digging into the issue, the team found that mariadb service is down on the database server.


Steps
ssh to database server
ssh peter@172.16.239.10
sudo systemctl enable mariadb.service
mv /var/lib/mysqld /var/lib/mysql #fixes error
sudo systemctl start mariadb.service
